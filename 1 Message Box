<p>By now you know who you want to reach, what value and barrier you will&nbsp;consider when trying to persuade them, and what communication approach you will use.&nbsp;Next you need to decide what to say. Again, it is important to consider your audience&rsquo;s value system, not your own. Review the persuasion points you identified above.</p>
<p><strong>Keep in mind these words of wisdom: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not what you want to tell them, it&rsquo;s what they can hear.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Tap your audience's value</li>
<li>Overcome their barrier</li>
<li>Ask them to take an action that moves you toward your goal</li>
<li>Echo your shared vision for change</li>
</ul>

<p>The message should resonate with your audiences. Make sure your messages:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Are based on the value or concern your audience holds that you want to tap;</li>
<li>Are worded using clear language your audience can understand;</li>
<li>Overcome &ndash; rather than reinforce &ndash; their barrier;</li>
<li>Have an ask that is in their comfort zone (or offers a benefit that outweighs the risk);</li>
<li>Emphasize reward and convey hope toward success; and</li>
<li>Are consistent with your chosen communication approach.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: No MY-EYES-GLAZE-OVER words or phrases in your messages.</strong></p>
<p>For an anti-litter effort in Texas, campaigners targeted young men who didn&rsquo;t really care about the environment or littering &ndash; but did carry enormous pride when it came to the Lone Star state. Keeping this value in mind, campaigners built messages that focused on the theme of state pride rather than littering. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Mess with Texas&rdquo; became a rallying cry about Texas rather than litter, and was ultimately an enormously successful campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Tip: A message is not a re-worded mission statement. E</strong><strong>ach message point should be one sentence and emphasize the big picture. You can include supporting points later.</strong></p>
<p>If you have more than one audience, create a tailored message for each in accordance with that audience's core concerns and your chosen communication approach. List the four message points for each of your audiences below.</p>
