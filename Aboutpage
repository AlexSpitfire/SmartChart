<p><strong>About Smart Chart</strong></p>
<p>Smart Chart was born in 2002 out of <a href="http://www.spitfirestrategies.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spitfire's</a> desire to help nonprofits spend less time worrying about communications and more time implementing effective strategies. Years later, we couldn&rsquo;t be more excited about all that Smart Chart has helped change makers achieve!&nbsp;</p>
<p>This interactive tool was designed to consolidate decades of strategic know-how, best practices, and lessons learned into an easy-to-use format. Over the years we have regularly updated Smart Chart to reflect new research and our own experiences on what makes for powerful communications that can change hearts and minds. We hope you&rsquo;ll find Smart Chart as valuable as the thousands of other nonprofits that have used it during the last decade!</p>
