<p>Frames, which cognitive scientists describe as &ldquo;mental structures that shape the way we see the world,&rdquo; set the broad terms of the debate, give shape to the discussion and define clear boundaries for how to think about an issue. Just like a picture frame, this shows what&rsquo;s in the picture, where we should pay attention and what the picture means.</p>

<p>Frames provide a definition of a problem, language around an issue, a solution and motivation for action according to sociologists Robert Benford and David Snow. A frame can direct how we think about ourselves and others, sometimes in biased ways, because a frame sets the terms and boundaries of the discussion and dictates the corresponding policies, actions and structures that have real-life impacts in our daily lives.</p>

<p>Think of frames as mental shortcuts that we rely on to quickly make sense of information and guide behavior. This is important, because studies from Adrian Furnham and Hua Chu Boo show that the first frame we experience on an issue becomes an anchor or reference point that we become tied to. Therefore, framing issues strategically will be important for moving people away from the frames or &ldquo;anchors&rdquo; that are harmful or do not support your work.</p>

<p>A new example of framing is around the issue of climate change and the reduction of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It&rsquo;s called Net Zero. It means that the amount of carbon added to the atmosphere can be no more than the amount we remove. Explaining, much less understanding, a complicated scientific concept and a possible solution could be mind-numbing to many. One group does it via a bathtub metaphor. You fill a bathtub with water by turning on the taps. You empty the tub by opening the drain. To maintain the amount of water in the tub at the right level, you have to keep the input and output the same. How easy was that?</p>

<p>For example, consider the issue of canceling student debt. One frame is opportunity and building a strong middle class. Another frame is equity and creating a more level playing field. People agree that the crushing burden that college loans impose on young people will follow them potentially the rest of their lives and is unsustainable. From there, you can make an economic argument or a moral argument or talk about the future among other approaches</p>
<p>You need to know whether you are framing a new conversation, fortifying and amplifying an existing conversation, or reframing a conversation to one that is more productive. Your first step is to analyze what the dominant conversation is. What frames, if any, exist around your issue? What assumptions are they built on? Are they harmful? How can you change the frame if you need to? You can do this by reviewing press coverage, language leaders use when talking about the issue and/or social media posts.</p>

<p>In the campaign to legalize same-sex marriage, groups leading the fight began with the frame that marriage was a civil right and should be open to LGBTQIA+ people. Through polling and focus groups, they found that this legal argument, while persuasive to many, didn&rsquo;t move enough people, and support for the issue plateaued. To regain momentum and after more research, they reframed their campaign to the values of our shared humanity: love, commitment and family. This new frame, which all groups picked up and reinforced, moved the needle. After all, keeping people apart who love and care for each other was hard to oppose.</p>
<p>This case study is also a clear example of asset framing, a concept developed by Trabian Shorters. Asset framing uplifts communities&rsquo; strengths (in this case, love, commitment and family) rather than referring to, or defining communities by the challenges they&rsquo;re facing.</p>
<p>No matter which option you take, a number of studies have found that to build support for issues, frames must resonate with the values, interests and worldviews of the audience or community in which the frames will be used.</p>
