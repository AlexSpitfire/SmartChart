<p>If there is no conversation, you need to frame one that is favorable to your perspective on the issue. You can usually determine this by searching on social and earned media (digital press, newspapers and nightly news) and noting how effectively your issue is covered. If there are conversations going on, and sometimes several can be competing for airtime, pick one that is favorable for your efforts and amplify it. If the dominant conversation isn&rsquo;t getting you where you want to go &ndash; e.g., the &ldquo;if you work hard you&rsquo;ll get ahead&rdquo; frame, which leaves out the systemic barriers that some communities disproportionately face &ndash; you&rsquo;ll want to move the conversation away from that narrative and start a new conversation with a different frame that gets different results.</p>

<p>An idea must be really new and mostly unheard of for it to be framed right out of the box. It is highly likely that the facts, stories or narratives, perceptions, supportive players and opposition are known, and there is already a debate in play. People already have a general opinion about the topic even if the way you approach it may be novel. The key is to understand how an issue is currently perceived in the world.</p>
<p>First, ask or research how those most affected by the issue and those with deep knowledge think about the issue. Include in your research those opposed to your viewpoint and how they represent the issue. Then, to gain perspective, review how your issue is portrayed and defined by the opposition and how successful their description is across your audiences. Conduct an earned media and social media audit to gauge how the issue is showing up on those outlets and platforms. Analyze the language these sources use. After you consider all of this information, assess whether there is a dominant frame or several frames. Of these, are they helpful, harmful or neutral?</p>
