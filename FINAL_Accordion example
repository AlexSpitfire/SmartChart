       <p>Remember: A goal is the victory that likely requires many decisions to get accomplished -- like getting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge named a national monument or making sure every working family member has paid leave. Think about all the things it will take to achieve the goal. In the case of paid family leave youâ€™ll have to raise money, get companies to adopt voluntary policies, pass policy at the state and federal level and get workers to take leave rather than go to work sick. Those are objectives.
