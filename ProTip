<h3 class="headline-28">Broken frames</h3>
<div class="entry-content --sm">
<p>Be careful about inadvertently reinforcing damaging frames. For years, immigration reform advocates supported The DREAM Act by saying that Dreamers (people who immigrated to the U.S. as children, without documentation) &ldquo;came to this country by no fault of their own. They didn&rsquo;t break any laws &ndash; they were children.&rdquo; That talking point reinforced the idea that their parents did break the law and built momentum for deporting their parents and splitting the family. A good rule of thumb is to advance frames that are asset based, or that reflect the strengths of the people and communities, rather than deficits or challenges. Ask yourself: does this frame highlight communities&rsquo; strengths and aspirations, or does it focus on their challenges and deficits? If you find that your message highlights challenges and deficits, consider an asset based frame.</p>
