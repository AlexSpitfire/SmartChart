<p>To paraphrase the Cheshire Cat in Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland,&rdquo; if you don&rsquo;t know where you are going, any road leads you there.</p>
<p>The good news is that you know where you are going. Write down what you want to achieve in your organization, project or program. Who is going to decide whether that happens? Identifying at the beginning your goal (the change you want to create), objective (the first step to get there) and decision-maker will help you create a strong communication strategy. Those are fixed points in your Smart Chart. Never lose sight of them.</p>
