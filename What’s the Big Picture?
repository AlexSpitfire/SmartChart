<h3>Your mission and goal</h3>
<p>All good communication efforts are rooted in a vision for change. This is likely the reason your group was created &ndash; your mission. It may be to ensure reproductive justice, to protect Black and Brown people from systemic racism, to ensure that every family in your community has affordable and nutritious food, to provide affordable housing, to protect wilderness areas or to make arts and cultural programming available to every student. This could be a big, tough change or a small but mighty one; but it is usually reflected in your mission statement. It explains your group&rsquo;s purpose, whom you serve, your core values and principles, what you are working toward and how you expect to do it. Other items you may have &ndash; like your organizational strategic plan, &ldquo;a theory of change&rdquo; or &ldquo;logic model&rdquo;2 &ndash; could also inform how you create your strategic communications plan by reminding you why you are doing this, for whom and how your group commits to doing its work.</p>

<h3 class="headline-28">Let's start off with a Pro Tip</h3>
<div class="entry-content --sm">
<p>When considering where to focus communication planning, look around the organization and ask: Do our communications line up with our strategic plan? Where are we not getting the attention we need to have the impact we want? Where are we stalled? Has the world changed enough that we need to reconsider what (or how) we are doing so it is more relevant and effective?</p>

<p>To achieve your mission, you likely need to achieve many goals. If your mission is to get everyone to take the census, your goal may be to increase the number of people from chronically undercounted populations who fill it out. It may not be something you can achieve in a short period of time. While your goal may take 10, 20 or 30 years to achieve, it&rsquo;s impossible to create a single communication plan that will last that long. Things change!</p>

<h3 class="headline-28">A Theory of Change or Logic Model</h3>

<p>Consequently, most concrete communication strategies are focused on the near term &ndash; like 24 months or less. That&rsquo;s the recommended time frame for your Smart Chart as well.</p>
<p>So, how do you reconcile a 20-year goal with a two-year plan? Simple. Break your goal into smaller pieces. Create steps you need to take to get to the goal, then plan your communication efforts to support those incremental points of progress. That&rsquo;s what we call an objective.</p>
