<div class="entry-content --lg">A goal is the victory that requires many decisions to accomplish &ndash; like getting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge named a national monument or making sure every worker has paid leave. Think about all the things it will take to achieve the goal. In the case of paid family leave, for example, you&rsquo;ll have to raise money, get companies to adopt voluntary policies, pass policy at the state and federal level, and get workers to take leave rather than go to work sick.</div>
<div class="entry-content --lg">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="entry-content --lg">Each of those are their own objectives that require communication to become reality. They are stepping stones to your goal. Each represents a step forward, and some need to happen simultaneously. Objectives are the Smart Chart&rsquo;s heart, so make sure your communications are focused on this priority. Establishing concrete, measurable objectives is the next step in your overall plan for achieving your goal.</div>
<div class="entry-content --lg">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="entry-content --lg">Objectives can be behavior change (getting people to either start or stop doing something), policy change (either government or corporate policy) and fundraising.</div>
<div class="entry-content --lg">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="entry-content --lg">A well-defined, specific objective is essential for a good communication strategy. If your objective is too broad or vague, the decisions you make from this point forward will lack precision, virtually guaranteeing an ineffective result. An ideal objective is measurable (you can tell whether you have achieved it) and should represent a clear program aim or action that your group or project can accomplish within a two-year time frame. In a word, your objective should be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-bound. Let me break it down for you:</div>

<div class="entry-content --lg">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="entry-content --lg">More often than not, organizations need multiple objectives to achieve their goal: the stepping stones mentioned before. If that&rsquo;s you, develop a separate Smart Chart for each objective. It is likely that the decision-makers, audiences and messages for each objective will be different.</div>
<div class="entry-content --lg">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="entry-content --lg">For example, if an organization wants to advance racial justice by ending discriminatory discipline practices in schools, it can advocate to increase the number of teachers who take implicit bias training (behavior change), hire more teachers who are from the same community as the students (school system policy change), raise money to offer scholarships to teachers to cover costs (fundraising), get schools to voluntarily track data to understand whether they have an issue and how severe it is (school policy change), pass legislation that replaces suspension and expulsion with other interventions (public policy change), or align school funding with low suspension and expulsion rates to incentivize more equitable practices (public policy change). Each is a different objective with different decision-makers and requires different communications.</div>

<h2 class="headline-28 --color-blue-dark">No &ldquo;Magical&rdquo; Objective Setting</h2>
Watch out for vague objectives such as &ldquo;raise public awareness.&rdquo; Usually &ldquo;public awareness&rdquo; is not an objective in and of itself. It is a midpoint on the road to changing behavior or a means of putting pressure on political or corporate leadership. You could do a poll before and after your efforts and determine that many people were aware of your work, but that didn&rsquo;t necessarily change their behavior or compel them to take action. &ldquo;Raise awareness&rdquo; is incomplete. Ask yourself: Why do you want to raise awareness? What will awareness do for you? Will you use it to pressure the city council to pass a bill to block evictions, change consumer behavior to reject single-use plastics or force drug companies to decrease the cost of immunizations? The &ldquo;why&rdquo; is your objective.</div>
<div class="entry-content --lg">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="entry-content --lg">State a specific objective and then decide how you are going to measure your progress toward that objective. &ldquo;Increasing racial equity&rdquo; or &ldquo;improving family health&rdquo; are certainly worthy aspirations, but they are big goals, not concrete objectives. &ldquo;Increasing the number of Black school teachers and administrators by 10% before the next academic year&rdquo; and &ldquo;providing health care coverage to 15% more children in three counties in the next 18 months&rdquo; are achievable objectives that lead up to your big goal.</div>
