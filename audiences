<h2 class="headline-28 --color-blue-dark">Priority audiences</h2>
<div class="entry-content --lg">
<p>When you think of audiences, think about segments of people. The general public is never an audience. Do not focus on it. If the general public means everyone and you have failed to select anyone, then no one will likely respond to your communications. Few messages appeal to all people. You may need to cast a wide net to get who you want; but you must still segment them to be specific, identifiable and persuadable.</p>

<h3 class="headline-28">Credibility</h3>
<div class="entry-content --sm">
<p>Sometimes you first need to build the credibility of an audience with a decision-maker before you activate them to engage with the decision-maker. This can be part of your strategy: to credential and then activate an audience.</p>
<p>You can segment your audiences by demographics (e.g., race, age, gender identity or expression, ethnicity, income, language, etc.), geography (where they live, work, learn or play), psychographics (people&rsquo;s beliefs, attitudes, opinions and behaviors) and other categories relevant to your work.</p>

<h3 class="headline-28">Core</h3>
<div class="entry-content --sm">
<p>Your audience may be smaller than you think. When it comes to moving an issue, there is no defined number of voices that will guarantee victory. Depending on the objective and your strategy, you may need masses of people to turn out. However, the number of people needed to make change is not necessarily &ldquo;as many as possible.&rdquo; Small numbers can make big things happen. A small group or even just one person may be the most influential to your decision-maker. Your job is to figure out how many you need to engage to get the job done. That is the most efficient way to plan. The smaller the audience, the easier it is to create a focused communication plan that will move the audience to action. That being said, sometimes small groups are still hard to move and require sophisticated effort.</p>

<p>People&rsquo;s brains are often irrational. Approaching communications as if our brains are rational and lead with facts over emotion means you&rsquo;ll miss opportunities to connect with and motivate your audiences. Check out how different people behave and how to encourage them to think and act the way you want. This table13 offers examples of psychological insights you may encounter. Some help you, and some make your communications more challenging. Knowing what you have to work with will help you create strategies that will work.</p>

<div class="entry-content --lg">
<p>Consider these factors when selecting your audiences (who are not the decision-maker):</p>
<ul>
<li>How close are they to the decision-maker? Are they actual influencers?</li>
<li>How easily can you reach the audience you want to take action?</li>
<li>Will they take action on your behalf?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="entry-content --lg">
<p>Start with people who have the ear of the decision-maker &ndash; who do they listen to, ask for advice from, refer to? Are any of these part of your circle, your community, on your lists and in your sphere of influence? As long as they are influential to the decision-maker, you want to consider them as an audience. If necessary, you can build out from there. Who do they know, and who can they engage with to take action?</p>
